Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and versatile code editor that has become a favorite among developers. One of the reasons for its popularity is the vast ecosystem of extensions that can enhance productivity and improve the development experience. In this post, I want to share some of my favorite VS Code extensions that I use regularly in all my projects.

* **Better SVG** - Provides better support for working with SVG files in VS Code. It offers features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and a live preview of the SVG, making it easier to work with vector graphics directly within the editor.
* **Code Spell Checker** - Helps catch spelling errors in your code, comments, and strings. It supports multiple languages and can be customized to include specific dictionaries or ignore certain words, making it a great tool for improving the quality of your code.
* **Error Lens** - Highlights errors and warnings directly in the editor, making it easier to spot and fix issues in your code.
* **File Nesting Updater** - Helps organize your files by automatically nesting related files together, improving project structure and navigation.
* **Pretty TypeScript Errors** - Provides more readable and user-friendly error messages for TypeScript, making it easier to understand and fix issues.
* **Project Manager** - Allows you to easily switch between projects, keeping your workspace organized and improving productivity.
* **Sort Everything** - Helps you sort various elements in your code, such as imports, keys, and arrays, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

These are the generic extensions that I find useful across different projects.
