[Some people](https://hicks.design/journal/hicks-design-best-15-albums) will have their go-to list of their favourite albums. As my first post on my blog (I'm not a stranger to maintaining a blog - I had one, back in the early naughties, that I regularly updated) I thought it apt to share what I can be guaranteed to tantalise my ears.

These aren't necessarily in favourite order, chronologically discovered is probably closer.

## L.S.U. - Shaded Pain

![L.S.U. - Shaded Pain album cover](../../assets/images/l-s-u--shaded-pain.jpg) Release in 1987 it contains 10 tracks, this is an album that stands out and causes a lot of polarised opinions. Most Mike Knott fans really don't like it, however I think it's such a gem.

Apart from Mike Knott's vocals, Brian Doidge provides superb guitar and bass. A fine example of this is the track "Plague Of Flies", and yes, this is how you get a guitar to buzz like the beating wings of 1,000 flies.

"Bye Bye Colour" (odd, an American band releasing an America album and spelling 'colour' the "correct" way) is a stand-out track, so is "Lonely Boy" (Bridgett Knott's haunting vocals, shiver!).

## The Choir - Chase The Kangaroo

![The Choir - Chase The Kangaroo album cover](../../assets/images/the-choir--chase-the-kangaroo.jpg) Originally released in 1988, it contained 10 tracks. They re-released the album in 2012 where it contains an additional 5 tracks taken off an earlier release ("Shades of Grey", released in 1986), this is usually the version you'll find on streaming services.

The album is dreamy, with touches of shoe-gaze. The production is probably what makes the album sound timeless.

Highlights for me personally have always been "Consider", "Clouds" and "Sad Face".

## Veil of Ashes - Pain

![Veil of Ashes - Pain album cover](../../assets/images/veil-of-ashes--pain.jpg) Released in 1989, it contains 11 tracks. Two of the members from "The Choir" contributed to this album, providing backing vocals on Track 1 and some engineering assistance.

Normally I have to be in a melancholy mood to listen to this album (I guess the title of the album give that away).

The opening track is their cover of Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'". A few songs in you're introduced to "Without Eyes"; which at the time was pointing fingers are the struggles happening in South Africa.

## Adam Again - Homeboys

![Adam Again - Homeboys album cover](../../assets/images/adam-again--homeboys.jpg) Released in 1990, it contains 10 tracks. Again there's contributions to this album by one of the members of "The Choir", it was also recorded at "Neverland", the studio owned by "The Choir".

The album is more blues than guitar-driven rock, there's plenty of Fender Rhodes organ scattered throughout. The album tells of hard-times, love and loss.

If I'm pressed, I'd say the must-listen songs are "Homeboys", "Hide Away" and "No Regrets". However, this album is so good listened to from start to finish.
