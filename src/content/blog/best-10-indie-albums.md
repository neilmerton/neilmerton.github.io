[Some people](https://hicks.design/journal/hicks-design-best-15-albums) will have their go-to list of their favourite albums. As my first post on my blog (I'm not a stranger to maintaining a blog - I had one, back in the early naughties, that I regularly updated) I thought it apt to share what I can be guaranteed to tantalise my ears.

These aren't necessarily in favourite order, chronologically discovered is probably closer.

## The Choir - Chase The Kangaroo

![The Choir - Chase The Kangaroo album cover](../../assets/images/the-choir--chase-the-kangaroo.jpg) Originally released in 1988, it contained 10 tracks. They re-released the album in 2012 where it contains an additional 5 tracks taken off an earlier release ("Shades of Grey", released in 1986), this is usually the version you'll find on streaming services.

The album is dreamy, with touches of shoe-gaze. The production is probably what makes the album sound timeless.

Highlights for me personally have always been "Consider", "Clouds" and "Sad Face".

## Veil of Ashes - Pain

![Veil of Ashes - Pain album cover](../../assets/images/veil-of-ashes--pain.jpg) Released in 1989, it contains 11 tracks. Two of the members from "The Choir" contributed to this album, providing backing vocals on Track 1 and some engineering assistance.

Normally I have to be in a melancholy mood to listen to this album (I guess the title of the album give that away).

The opening track is their cover of Bob Dylan's "The Time They Are A Changin'". A few songs in you're introduced to "Without Eyes"; which at the time was pointing fingers are the struggles happening in South Africa.
