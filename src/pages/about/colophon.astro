        This website is built using <a
          href="https://astro.build"
          target="_blank">Astro</a
        >, and I have to say I'm really enjoying it. It's a great tool for
        building static sites, and it's really easy to use. I can write my blog
        and reading content in Markdown, and Astro takes care of the rest. It's
        also really fast, which is great for SEO and user experience.

        Each push to the main branch of it's <a
          href="https://github.com/neilmerton/neilmerton.github.io"
          target="_blank">repository</a
        > triggers a build on Vercel, which then deploys the site. It's a great workflow,
        and it means that I can make changes to the site and see them live in seconds.

        I've not used a utility CSS framework for my site. I prefer to write my
        CSS using plain old CSS, and I find that it works well for me. I can
        create classes and keep my styling and presentation separate, which is
        important to me. I also find that I can compose pure CSS much quicker
        than constantly having to remember what the utility framework's class
        might be to achieve the style I'm after.

        There's no cookies or tracking on this site. I value my privacy, and
        that of my visitors, and I don't want to collect any data on them. I
        also don't want to have to deal with the legal implications of
        collecting data, so it's just easier to not do it at all.
