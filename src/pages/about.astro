      <p>
        Hi — I'm {siteConfig.name}. I build web experiences that are fast,
        accessible, and a pleasure to use. I've been working in frontend
        development for over six years, and I still get excited when a layout
        clicks together or an interaction feels just right.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care a lot about the fundamentals: semantic HTML, progressive
        enhancement, and CSS that works without a framework attached. I believe
        the web is at its best when it's open and accessible to everyone,
        regardless of their device, connection, or ability.
      </p>

      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>
        I work best at the intersection of engineering and design — translating
        designs into living, breathing interfaces with attention to the nuances
        that make software feel polished. I'm comfortable talking to designers
        about typographic rhythm and to backend engineers about API contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer small, focused teams where I can have a real impact. I value
        clear communication, considered code review, and a shared commitment to
        quality.
      </p>

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not at a keyboard, you'll find me reading (see my
        <a href="/reading">reading list</a>), hiking, or experimenting with
        sourdough. I write occasionally about frontend development and the craft
        of building for the web — you can find that on my <a href="/blog"
          >blog</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>
      <p>
        I'm always happy to hear from other developers, potential collaborators,
        or anyone with an interesting project. The best way to reach me is
        <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.email}`}>{siteConfig.email}</a>, or via <a
          href="/contact">the contact page</a
        >.
