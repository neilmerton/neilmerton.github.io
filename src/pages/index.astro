  <h1>Hey there</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Neil Merton, a frontend developer, keen <span class="subtle"
      >(but considered)</span
    > mountain biker and family man.
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally born and raised in South Africa I subsequently moved to the UK in
    the 1990s. I eventually settled in Cheshire, England, where I live with my
    wife, three children, two dogs and three cats.

  <p>
    I've been pushing web-pixels since 1997. So much has changed since the days
    of using tables and 1px by 1px transparent gifs to do layouts. Thankfully
    most of those browser wars are a distant memory, and I survived the dot com
    crash at the turn of the millennium.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remain passionate about producing accessible web platforms that are a joy
    to use <span class="subtle">(for users)</span> and logical to maintain <span
      class="subtle">(for developers)</span
    >.
